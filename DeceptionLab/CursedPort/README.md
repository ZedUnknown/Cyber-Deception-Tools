_For example:_

www.youtube.com  
www.github.com  
www.google.com  
.

Make sure to remove any extra characters, spaces, or line breaks. This format will help prevent hackers from accessing the original websites.

## Customizing Generated URLs

The script provides options to customize the generated URLs. Here are the configurable parameters and their descriptions:

- `HOST`: The host address where the server will run. By default, it is set to an empty string.
- `PORT`: The port number on which the server will listen. By default, it is set to `8000`.

- `URLs_PER_GENERATE`: The range of how many URLs to generate per page. By default, it is set to generate between 7 and 12 URLs.
- `LENGTH_OF_URL`: The range of the length of each generated URL. By default, it is set to generate URLs with lengths between 20 and 32 characters.

- `TIMEOUT`: The delay (in milliseconds) between receiving a request and serving a response. By default, it is set to `350`.

- `ENABLE_UPPER_CASE`: Enable or disable uppercase letters in generated URLs. By default, it is set to `True`.
- `ENABLE_LOWER_CASE`: Enable or disable lowercase letters in generated URLs. By default, it is set to `True`.
- `ENABLE_DIGITS`: Enable or disable digits (numbers) in generated URLs. By default, it is set to `True`.
- `ENABLE_PUNCTUATIONS`: Enable or disable punctuation characters in generated URLs. By default, it is set to `True`.

Feel free to modify these parameters in the script to customize the behavior of the generated URLs according to your preferences.

## Running the Code

To run the code, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python cursedport.py
```
This will run the code with the default settings. If you prefer to use custom website names, you can provide a text file with the -f flag:

```bash
python cursedport.py -f FILENAME.txt
```
The file should contain a list of website names, with each name on a separate line.
